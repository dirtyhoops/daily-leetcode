# Description

Given an array of strings `words`, return the first **palindromic** string in the array. If there is no such string, return an **empty string** `""`.

A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1**:

```
Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
```

**Example 3**:

```
Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
```
