# Description

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: nums = [2, 2, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the only number in the nums array that only appeared once, so return 1
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3**:

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```
