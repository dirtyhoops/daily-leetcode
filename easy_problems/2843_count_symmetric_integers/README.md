# Description

You are given two positive integers `low` and `high`.

An integer `x` consisting of `2 * n` digits is **symmetric** if the sum of the first `n` digits of `x` is equal to the sum of the last `n` digits of `x`. Numbers with an odd number of digits are never symmetric.

Return the **number of symmetric** integers in the range `[low, high]`.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: low = 1, high = 100
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 symmetric integers between 1 and 100: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: low = 1, high = 100
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 symmetric integers between 1 and 100: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
