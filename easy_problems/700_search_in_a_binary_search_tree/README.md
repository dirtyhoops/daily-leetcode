# Description

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `val`.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals `val` and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return `null`.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []
```
