# Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```
