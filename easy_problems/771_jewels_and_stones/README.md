# Description

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```
